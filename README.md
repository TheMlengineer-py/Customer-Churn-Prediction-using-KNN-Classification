# Customer-Churn-Prediction-using-KNN-Classification
The goal of the churn data analysis and KNN classification task  is to identify the factors that contribute to customer churn rate and to develop strategies to reduce churn rate, increase product retention rate. By analysing customer data, organizations can gain insights into the patterns and trends that are associated with customer attrition, such as changes in purchase behavior, usage patterns, customer demographics, and other relevant data points

The KNN (k-nearest neighbor) classification method analyses the customer datasets to predict customer churn rate by using a supervised learning algorithm. In this method, the algorithm classifies customers as either churners or non-churners based on their similarity to other customers in the dataset.
The KNN algorithm works by comparing a new customer's features (such as  Contract, product usage, payment method, PaperlessBilling, Onlinesecurity, Gender, Age, Area,Employment, PaymentMethodetc.) to those of other customers in the dataset. The algorithm then assigns the new customer to the class of the K nearest neighbors (i.e., the K customers in the dataset that are most similar to the new customer). The predicted class for the new customer is determined by the majority class of the K nearest neighbors
The expected outcome of applying KNN classification to the customer dataset is a predictive model that can be used to identify customers who are at high risk of churn. This model can be used to inform retention strategies and to help organizations take proactive steps to retain these customers before they decide to switch to a competitor. The outcome of the KNN classification may also provide insights into the factors that contribute to customer churn, which can inform future product and marketing strategies to increase business product retention rate and revenue
The results of the KNN classifier show that the best performing model was achieved with a value of K equal to 1 and using uniform weights. The training score of the KNN model was 0.8518, which indicates that the model was able to accurately classify 85.18% of the training data.

The KNN AUROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve) was calculated to be 0.7993, which is a metric used to evaluate the performance of binary classification models. The AUROC measures the ability of the model to distinguish between positive and negative instances, and a value of 0.5 indicates that the model is no better than random guessing, while a value of 1.0 indicates a perfect classifier. In this case, the KNN AUROC of 0.7993 suggests that the KNN model is able to distinguish between churned and retained customers with a good degree of accuracy.
The KNN test performance of 0.82 indicates that the model was able to correctly classify 82% of the test data. This is a measure of how well the model is likely to perform on new, unseen data.Overall, the results of the KNN classifier suggest that the model has good predictive power for customer churn analysis, with an accuracy of 82% and a relatively high AUROC of 0.7993.

The precision for class 1 (churned customers) was 0.83, which means that out of all the instances that were predicted to belong to class 1, 83% of them were actually true positives. The recall for class 1 was 0.89, which means that out of all the instances that actually belonged to class 1, the model correctly identified 89% of them. The f1-score for class 1 was 0.86, which is a weighted average of the precision and recall, and represents the harmonic mean of the two metrics.

For class 0 (retained customers), the precision was 0.81, which means that out of all the instances that were predicted to belong to class 0, 81% of them were actually true positives. The recall for class 0 was 0.71, which means that out of all the instances that actually belonged to class 0, the model correctly identified 71% of them. The f1-score for class 0 was 0.75, which is also a weighted average of the precision and recall.

The results still suggest that the KNN classifier is able to identify retained customers with higher accuracy compared to churned customers, as evidenced by the higher recall and f1-score for class 1. However, the precision and recall values for class 1 suggest that the model has some difficulty in correctly identifying churned customers, with a higher false positive rate compared to class 0

The limitation of the KNN classifier in customer churn analysis is the curse of dimensionality. The curse of dimensionality refers to the fact that as the number of features (i.e., dimensions) in the dataset increases, the amount of data required to accurately represent the feature space grows exponentially. This can make it difficult to find enough similar instances to make reliable predictions
